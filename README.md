# Brain-Tumor-Classification


This repository contains the code for a comprehensive brain tumor classification project developed by Anagha Nagesh. The project aims to classify brain tumor images into different categories using deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview

Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells within the brain that can be benign or malignant. Early detection and classification of brain tumors play a crucial role in treatment planning and patient prognosis. This project focuses on developing a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying brain tumor images into categories such as glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumor.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Brain Tumor Classification MRI dataset, which is available on Kaggle. The dataset consists of MRI images of brain tumors categorized into different classes. Each image is associated with a specific tumor type, making it suitable for supervised learning tasks.

## Methodology

Anagha Nagesh adopted a systematic approach to tackle the brain tumor classification task. The methodology involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The raw MRI images undergo preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to enhance model generalization and performance.

2. **Model Building:** Anagha explores various deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning using pre-trained models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, and Xception. The goal is to leverage the pre-trained features and fine-tune the model for optimal performance on the brain tumor classification task.

3. **Model Training:** The model is trained using the labeled dataset, with appropriate optimization techniques and callbacks such as early stopping and model checkpointing to monitor and improve performance. Training metrics and loss functions are utilized to assess the model's convergence and effectiveness.

4. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Anagha analyzes the results to gain insights into the model's performance and identify potential areas for improvement.

## Results and Discussion

The project yields promising results in classifying brain tumor images, with an accuracy of [insert accuracy]. Anagha discusses the strengths and limitations of the model, highlighting factors such as class imbalances, data augmentation strategies, and model architecture choices. Insights from the evaluation process inform future directions for enhancing the model's performance and robustness.
